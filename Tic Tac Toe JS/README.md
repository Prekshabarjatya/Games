## Overview

This project is a browser-based Tic Tac Toe game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game provides an interactive and visually appealing experience for two players taking turns on the same device.

## Gameplay

- Two players alternate turns. Circle (blue) goes first, then Cross (red).
- Click an empty square to place a mark.
- After each move the game checks for a win (rows, columns, diagonals).
- If a player wins, a winning message appears and all other squares become unclickable.
- To play again, refresh the page (there is no explicit restart button).

## Implementation details

### HTML structure
- The HTML contains a header with the game title and a brief description.
- The main board element (`#gameboard`) is generated/filled with nine squares (`.square`).
- An information display (`#info`) shows messages like whose turn it is or who has won.

### CSS styling
- The page is centered and designed for a clean, minimal look.
- The game board is laid out as a 3x3 grid (`#gameboard`). Each cell uses the `.square` class â€” white boxes inside a dark container.
- Marks are visually distinct:
  - Circles: blue-bordered circles.
  - Crosses: red, formed with two intersecting lines (implemented via pseudo-elements).
- The board and marks scale responsively for a polished appearance on different screen sizes.

### JavaScript gameplay logic
- On load, the script creates nine clickable squares.
- Players alternate turns; a state variable tracks the current player and toggles after each valid move.
- When a square is clicked:
  - A circle or cross is rendered in that cell.
  - The square is disabled to prevent further clicks.
  - The info display updates to indicate the next player.
  - The game checks all winning combinations (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals).
- If a win is detected, the script displays a winning message and disables the remaining squares to end the round.

## How to run locally

1. Clone the repo:
   `git clone https://github.com/Prekshabarjatya/Games.git`
2. Open the Tic Tac Toe folder and open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the folder with a simple static server:
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Then open `http://localhost:8000/Tic%20Tac%20Toe/`

## Possible improvements

- Add a Restart / Replay button so users don't need to refresh the page.
- Add a single-player mode with AI (easy / medium / hard).
- Add animations or sound effects for moves and wins.
- Add a scoreboard to track multiple rounds.
- Add unit tests for win/draw detection logic.
